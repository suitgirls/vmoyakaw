        Valentina Maria Oyakawa Zapata
        Graduated 2024, Peru
        I want to exapand my knoeledge in the tecnology field and use it to make the world a better place. FFutheremore, I will use my experience to encourage more woman into this field.
        Antisismic and construction technology. However, I really like cybersecurity technology.
        Outside of school I like to workout, watch movies, cook some pastries and most important spend time with the people that I love the most. I have an amazing family, even though my parents are divorced. A fun fact and random fact about me is that if you have me as a friend in tiktok, probably you will recieve 100 daily, not kidding. I am a person who thinks that we have a porpouse in the world related to the well-being of everyone that surrounds us, therefore, I will like in the future to create an ONG that construct eco friendly and low cost buildings for poor people.
        I consider myself a funny person and a good friend, so don't be afraid to talk to me about any random theme or situation.
